INTRODUCTION                                           *textobj-punctuation*

|vim-textobj-punctuation| is a Vim plugin providing text objects |iu| and |au|
(|u| stands for pUnctuation, as |p| is already taken for paragraphs) for
capturing the text between the current cursor position and a punctuation
character in front.  This punctuation character can be one of: |,|, |.|, |:|,
|;|, |!|, and |?|. The text object can span multiple lines to reach the closest
punctuation character.  Some examples (the cursor is shown with |||):

- Before: String |foo = "bar";; after pressing |diu|: String |;
- Before: if |i == 42:; after pressing |diu|: if |:
- Before: Vim is |a nice editor!; after pressing |ciuthe best editor ever|:
  Vim is the best editor ever!

The plugin uses |vim-textobj-user| developed by Kana Natsuno and requires it to
be installed: https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-user

MAPPINGS                                      *textobj-punctuation-mappings*

By default the pluging provides |iu| and |au| mappings to operate on the
content until and including the closest punctuation.

As most of the time, you need to operate on the text until punctuation, I add
the following bindings to make it even more convenient to use:
>
  xmap u iu
  omap u iu
>
Now, you just need to press |cu|, |du|, |yu|, or |vu| to operate on the text
until the closest punctuation.
